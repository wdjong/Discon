    <h1>DISCON</h1>

    <h2>Play</h2>
    <p>Move by dragging your number piece in a L-Shape, 2 squares in 1 direction then 1 square at right angles, like a chess knight</p>
    <p>When you land on a coloured piece it becomes part of your tower. When you drag it to your next move it remains part of your tower.</p>
    <p>If you want to leave a tower behind, you should use the right button to drag your numbered piece.</p>
    <p>You can click on a tower to see its constituent colours.</p>

    <h2>Premium game (for adults) *** This is the implemented version ****</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Game ends when all discs have been collected. A maximum of 2 colours may make up a tower./li>

        <li>Height becomes important and receives premium. (Scoring per the chart below)</li>
        <li>Any number of towers may be built.</li>

    <h2>Other version ideas (from original rules)</h2>
    <h2>Elementary game (for children)</h2>
    <p>Try to collect a disc of any colour with every move. The player who first erects the required number of towers of maximum height wins.</p>
    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 players:	4 towers,	12 storeys high.</li>
        <li>3 players:	4 towers,	8 storeys high.</li>
        <li>4 players:	3 towers,	8 storeys high.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For small children reduce height and increase number of towers.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic game</h2>
    <p>
        Play continues until all discs are collected. Each player may use all colours at random to erect any number of towers up to 12 storeys high.
        Score 2 points for each violet disc, 4 points for a blue or a pink disc, and 8 points for each ivory disc.
    </p>

    <h3>Variation 1.</h3>
    <p>Each tower use be composed of 2 colours, or one colour only.</p>

    <h3>Variation 2.</h3>
    <p>Each tower must be of single colour only.</p>

    <h2>Advanced premium game</h2>
    <p>
        Premium game with additional premium for erecting towers with 2 colours alternating (i.e. pink-blue-pink-blue etc.).
        For such towers allocate 3 times the mixed colour score for appropriate height. (This is not implemented in this version)
    </p>

    <p><b>Alternating colours</b>: Allocate three times the mixed colour score for appropriate height.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Penalty</b>: For each excess storey reduce the maximum allowed height by one, and score accordingly.
        (I.e. if max. height = 8; a 9-storey tower scores 7-storeys; a 10-storey tower scores 6 storeys etc.)
    </p>


    <h2>Further versions</h2>
    <p>
        The players can easily invent other versions. They may specify different and/or more colour-combinations, change the height regulations, and alter the scoring system.
        They can even modify the method of play. (This implementation doesn't support any of this)')
    </p>

    <p>A competition game may be organized by setting up two or more boards with identical pattern and appropriately increasing the number of players.</p>
